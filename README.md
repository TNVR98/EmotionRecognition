# Emotion Recognition
A Computer vision project to create several image classifier models that can recognize 
the emotion on the human face of an image passed to it. 
### The classifiers used are:
-  Support Vector Machine (SVM)
-  Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
-  Random Forest

### Feature Extractors used: 
 -ScaleInvariant Feature Transform (SIFT) 
 - Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)

### Full Lists of models trained: 
- 


The models were created and trained on Google 
Colab using Python and computer vision libraries.
