# Emotion Recognition
A Computer vision project to create several image classifier models that can recognize 
the emotion on the human face of an image passed to it. 
The models were created and trained on Google Colab using Python and computer vision libraries.

The "GoogleColab" folder contains the code implementation of the project and the file "Tanvir_CV_report.pdf" inside the "report" folder contains the detailed report of the project. 

### Feature Extractors used: 
 - ScaleInvariant Feature Transform (SIFT):  
 - Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)

### The classifiers used are:
-  Support Vector Machine (SVM)
-  Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
-  Random Forest

### The list of the models trained are: 
- HOG-SVM
- SIFT-SVM
- HOG-MLP
- SIFT-MLP
- HOG-Random Forest Classifier
- SIFT-Random Forest Classifier
